                                    <p><strong>(Mattew 5:13-16)</strong></p>
                                    <p>While explaining the true blessedness of a disciple, Jesus analogizes his followers with that of salt and light. As he brings out the two analogies, he helps them to get a picture of themselves. That is, to make them cogitate well their nature, weaknesses, and their obligations.</p><p>• Salt of the Earth<br>What is the use of salt if it doesn’t have its qualities? It is of no use except to be thrown out. Likewise, people claiming to be Christians must have the attributes of Christ, our leader. Without having the traits of Christ, the so-called Christians are a burden to this God. They also become so useless that people want to get rid of them.</p><p>• Light of the World<br>In a world where darkness prevailed, Jews were entrusted to hold the lamp of God’s light in this corrupted world. But where they fail, the light (Jesus) itself appears in this ignorant and dissolute world. It was essential to light up a new flame by the one who dwells in the unapproachable light for the caliginous world (1 Thessalonians.6:16). After the resurrection of Jesus, the flame was lit up. It was lit into the church, by the Holy Spirit, that we could be a beacon for this world.</p><p><strong>Application/Reflection</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A13-16&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew 5:13-16</a>):</p><p>After the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, he left for us the Holy Spirit and the Bible that contains life and teachings about him. In this world, where people are endlessly struggling for inner peace and joy, the latter lies obscured. Where lies and deception revolve around the evil world and man’s reasoning and intellect fail, struggle for wisdom can only be found from light (Jesus) itself. With the help of the Holy Scriptures, this only can be lit up by the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Are you a person led in truth by the Holy Spirit or wandering in the lust of this deceptive world? If you are depressed or neglected from this world, start delving into the scriptures and pray to the creator to bind you in the light of truth.</p>

                                    <h3> What is True Blessedness?</h3>

                                <div id="post-desc-left">
                                    <p>Jesus begins the longest discourse in the bible with nine “Blessed are you…” statements. The crux of the teaching is what true blessedness in The Kingdom means. ‘Christ teaches that the greatest joy and happiness is not in the conveniences and pleasures of this life but is laid up in heaven for those who willingly rest in the goodwill and pleasure of God’ states the Geneva Commentary.</p><p>These statements come across as an introduction to the next section (Matthew 5, 6 and 7) which we are going to survey. This is traditionally known as the “sermon on the mount”. It is the highest ethical teaching in the Bible. It is vastly even beyond the ten commandments of Moses which were given on another mountain.</p><p>Let us explore.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:1-12&amp;version=NIV" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:1-12&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 5: 1-12</a></strong> <strong>Reflection/Application</strong>:</p><p>Blessedness in the eyes of the world is measured by external prosperity. However, blessedness in the kingdom of God is measured by internal contrition (see verses 3 and 4). True blessedness in the eyes of God is determined by weighing the integrity and the strongest pursuit of a man’s heart (see verses 5,6,7 and 8). True blessedness is the endurance of a weary soul in the midst of opposition (see verses 9,10 and 11) for the sake of Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The word ‘blessed’ means happy. Happy because they are the ones who are made partakers of the divine. In the kingdom, true joy or blessing is found only when we begin to realise how destitute we are without Christ. Then and only then we can be filled with every spiritual blessing in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 1:3). Let us not count what we possess physically and account that to being blessed. Rather, let us consider who we are in the light of these verses; that is true blessedness.&nbsp;</p><p>How blessed are we today?</p><p><strong>Prayer:</strong></p><p>Lord, open my eyes today to count not what I possess, but to consider who I am in You. For that indeed is being truly blessed. Amen.</p>
